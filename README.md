# Magic 8-Ball Badge created in the lead up to DefCon 26 #BadgeLife

## Getting Started

Welcome to the Magic 8-Ball Badge files/guide.

Here you will find a svg image of the PCB and all the schematics, gerbers and Kicad files you need to make your own Magic 8-Ball Badge. I recommend @MrTwinkleTwink's video on how to convert svg images to Kicad files using Inkscape if you want to make any board chances (https://youtu.be/61NFK9KW)  
First off, as a warning, I'm by no stretch of the imagination a professional PCB designer and while I have tested the circuit on a similar project I've yet to receive and test this PCB (Will update when I do). Make sure to check through the schematics and make any changes you feel fit. And try not to have an aneurysm when you look at my wiring.

## Quirks:

There are a few quirks to this board. One ~~flaw~~ feature is that the switch doesn't power the PCB on and off but switches the power from the 8-Ball circuit to the Shitty Add-On headers. Another quirk is that I couldn't find the footprint for a SW-200D tilt switch so I just used a simular looking compentent.
